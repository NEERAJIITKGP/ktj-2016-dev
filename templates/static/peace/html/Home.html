Child malnutrition, encompassing undernutrition, obesity, and overweight, is prevalent in low and middle-income countries and severely impedes human, social and economic development. Undernourished children have significantly lower chances of survival than children who are well-nourished. They are much more prone to serious infections and to die from common childhood. The risk of dying increases with the severity of the under-nutrition. Nutrition is important to ensure proper brain formation and development, which starts in the womb: Development of the brain starts during early childhood.<br>
Evidence suggests that children who are stunted often enrol late in school, complete fewer grades and perform less well in school. This, in turn, affects their creativity and productivity in later life and fall ill more often. It has also been established that children with deficient growth before age two are at an increased risk of chronic disease as adults, especially if they gain weight rapidly in the later stages of childhood. A low birth weight baby, who is stunted and underweight in its infancy and gains weight rapidly in childhood and adult life, is much more prone to chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. <br>
Although a wide ranging harmful short-and long term effects of malnutrition have been well-documented, more evidence is needed to investigate and demonstrate the causal link between Nutrition for Human Resource and the development of human capital, and quantify the economic effects.<br>

The scale and complexity of the challenge posed by malnutrition is enormous. All stakeholders need to contribute to addressing it, including social entrepreneurs.<br>
