Note: Parachutes and Para aircrafts do not qualify as aircrafts since they do not have lift. Also airships which contain gases lighter than air are not considered as aircrafts and hence will not be allowed.</li>\r\n<li>Although there are no constraints on size and weight of the aircraft, it is advisable to keep the wingspan less than 1.75 meter and weight less than 900 grams.</li>\r\n<li>The aircraft should be motor powered. Use of IC (Internal combustion) engine is not allowed.</li>\r\n<li>The voltage of the battery used should not be more than 12V.</li>\r\n<li>It is advisable to include a good landing gear system in the design and construction phase of your aircraft. Remember, taking-off and landing are very important phases of this competition.</li>\r\n<li>The participants are free to use any materials of their choice. However the use of Balsa wood, Styrofoam or Sun Board is advisable. Balsa wood is light and easy to handle and to fabricate, hence is a good choice.</li>\r\n<li>Participating teams are not allowed to use any electronic system that may augment the stability and control of the aircraft, like gyroscopes in an auto-pilot. For the purposes of the competition, no electronic performance enhancement should be used. Remember, the competition is a test of the design, construction and flight performance of your aircraft.</li>\r\n<li>Participants must make all parts of the aircrafts themselves. Usage of Ready-to-Fly (RTF) and Almost-Ready-to-Fly (ARF) kits are strictly prohibited. However, the kit comprising of unassembled cut-pieces of balsa wood is allowed since it requires skilled work to be done upon it and one can assemble it to his or her advantage. Also use of readymade actuators/motors, remote controls is allowed.
